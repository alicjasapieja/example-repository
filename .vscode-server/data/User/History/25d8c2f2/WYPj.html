<p>“Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?”</p>
<ol>
    <li>To try something new...</li>
    <p>I choose to study software engineering to try something differnt. 
        I am currently studying law at the same time and wish to encorporate 
        a different skill level compared to other as I believe Software is our 
        future and we should all learn more in this field.</p>

    <li>To challenge myself in an area I have no knowlege in...</li>
    <p>I also choose to study this course as I have no backround in this area... 
    even though I use the internet and a computer everyday to actually immerse myself 
    to understand coding or how to make a website. This is all very facinating to me 
    and I am really excited to learn all about software.is made is pretty cool and I 
    am quite impressed that I will learn all of this </p>

    <li>Software Engineering is the future...</li>
