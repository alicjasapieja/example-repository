<title>Alicja Sapieja's First Blog Post</title>
<h1>My first blog post</h1>
<p>“Why did you decide to study Software Engineering?”</p>
<ol>
    <li>To try something new...</li>
    <p>I choose to study software engineering to try something differnt. 
        I am currently studying law at the same time and wish to encorporate 
        a different skill level compared to other as I believe Software is our 
        future and we should all learn more in this field.</p>

    <li>To challenge myself in an area I have no knowlege in...</li>
    <p>I also choose to study this course as I have no backround in this area of study... 
    even though I use the internet and a computer everyday I never took the opportunity 
    to understand software although I've always been impressed in those who were tech savy. 
    To have this opportunity to learn the ins and outs of software is very exciting.</p>

    <li>Software Engineering is the future...</li>
    <p>My third point is self explanatory 'software is the future' we now use software more than ever. 
        I also know this industry is continiously advancing and I would like to understand more about it. 
        Not only for personal growth but one day it would be great to put these skills into a project of my own
        or incorporate these skills to create something instead of paying someone else to do it for me. </p>
    </ol>
